As my first actual post on this new blog I thought I would do something very silly and pointless.  What better way to start off a new adventure than to write some _very_ obfuscated code.  The following is a mess and it is meant to be that way.  To be honest I wrote this a while ago and I have a slightly decrypted copy that still doesn't even make sense.  Enjoy!

```{r, tidy=FALSE}
h=character;r=rep;a=b=h(0);p=options()$width%/%2-5;n="
";j=r(toupper(substring(mode(a),4,4)),sum(r(5:9,2)+1)-3)
k=r(5:9,2);k[4:5]=7;k=cumsum(k+1);j[k]=n;m=paste(h(1), 
h(1));s=c(0,k[-10])+1;j[c(16:17,24:26,32:33,46:47,53:55,
61:64,70:74)]=m;for(i in 1:10)a=c(a,r(m,p),j[s[i]:k[i]])
cat(c(n,a),sep=b)
```
