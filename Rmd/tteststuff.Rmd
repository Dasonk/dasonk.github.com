$$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i$$

If we let $$ \beta_0 = 10 $$ and $$\beta_1 = 15$$ and let $$n=30$$ then we could have a model blah blah

```{r}
b0 <- 10
b1 <- 11
n <- 30
x <- rep(c(0,1), each = n)
y <- b0 + x*b1 + rnorm(n, 0, 1)
ttestOutput <- t.test(y ~ x, var.equal = FALSE)
lmOutput <- summary(lm(y ~ x))
```
