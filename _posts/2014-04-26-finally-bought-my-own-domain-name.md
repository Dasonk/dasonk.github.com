I did it.  I finally bought my own domain name.  You'll notice that
the site is now dasonk.com instead of dasonk.github.io.  Previously
I didn't want to have to pay a monthly fee and that's what I thought
I would have to do for a domain name.  Turns out I'm an idiot and since
github is already hosting my site all I needed to do was purchase
the domain name.  I used Hover and the site cost $12 a year (I found
an online coupon to reduce the price by $3).  I could have
obtained the domain name for cheaper but I've read good things about
Hover so I decided to go through them.  Then it was just a matter
of configuring a few things so that the github site would show up
when you visit dasonk.com.  I'm sure most of you know all of this
but I never really cared enough to learn it and finally decided
to take that step.

Now that I updated the domain name over the next few days I'm 
thinking I'm going to give this entire place an overhaul: new theme,
new layout, make it more than just a blog...
