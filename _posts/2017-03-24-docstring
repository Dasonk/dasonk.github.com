_This was originally posted at [Point Mass Prior](http://dasonk.github.com) and features MathML.  If you're viewing the blog elsewhere the math probably won't show up properly and it would be beneficial to view the post [here]({{ page.url }})_

I official submitted version 1.0.0 of [docstring](https://github.com/Dasonk/docstring) to CRAN. Hopefully a release will be on CRAN in the near future. Once that goes live I'll post an update with more information about the package.
