## About Me

I used to be a graduate student studying Statistics at Iowa State University.  I am currently a data scientist working at PwC. I love R and Linux. I have been happily married since April of 2011. I have a beagle named Luna and I'm sure she loves you.

I grew up in Lake Mills, WI.  I did my undergrad at Winona State University where I majored in both Mathematics and Statistics and did a minor in Computer Science.  I guess I'm a nerd.

I enjoy programming in R.  You can browse some of the projects I've been working on at [my github page](http://www.github.com/Dasonk).  I am also active at [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/1003565/dason) and mostly answer questions related to the [r] tag (but occasionally am able to answer a [knitr] question before Yihui is able to sneak in and answer it).
