## Stats ideas

 - Post on why to use FDR
 - Post on comparing when to use t-tests
 - Assessing different types of convergence
 - Analyze anscombe data for the hell of it
 - What makes a "linear model" linear.
 - More accurate birthday paradox calculator - take into account distribution of birthdays
 - Compare Normal vs. T(n-1) vs. T(n) for binomial confidence intervals
 - Mixed models vs. WLS with nested data
 - Compare Chi-square to LRT for test of proportions
      where the goal is to establish "close"
 - The following:
the danger occurs that "everything becomes significant" (even minor, practically irrelevant effects).
This is not an argument against large sample sizes, it's a direct argument against hypothesis testing for your particular problem.

If you have a problem rejecting for small effect sizes don't use ordinary hypothesis tests.

It may be that you need an equivalence test (or perhaps a noninferiority test).

It may be that you need an interval estimate of the effect size (i.e. a confidence interval).

It may be that you need something else.

This also relates to Position 3. If you have a notion of a "relevant effect" you should not be using ordinary hypothesis tests.

If your position is not that more power is better, stop using those hypothesis tests. It's not the correct tool for that job.
